The enclosed code is a GUI interface, along with the accompanying R functions that I used to analyze the massive amounts of methane and CO data for the Methane Monitoring Network in California.  I wrote all of this code for the California EPA.  Please contact me with any questions.  
Contact me with inquiries about using this code commercially, but it is free for personal use.
